The Official REPL for Baking.

# Project Standards
* When in doubt look for the newest most functional and useful spec/rfc.
* Use the best tool for the job, not just the hammer you know very well.  Be open to learning how to leverage other peoples tools, but call out the problems associated with them freely and respectfully.

# Project Code Of Conduct
* This project is a meritocracy with a BDFL that values functional software and engineering/cooking excellence over personal opinion or political bias.
* If something is offensive, then it probably needs to be re-factored into smaller parts so its easier to understand and thus made less offensive by that clarity.
* We are all human and should be acting like adults, so please act like it. Swearing is OK, but insulting others is not. If there is a technical issue, the problem is technical and not with the people, so don't insult people when the problem is technical.
* In the case you are not a human adult, legally I cant have you here without your designated adult helping you.
* All Adult Humans are welcome to contribute regardless of race, gender, gender identity, hair color, whatever, as long as they understand that this is a meritocracy per the above.

# Project Code Of Conduct and Possible Claims of Discrimination
* Complaints have been made that our CoC unfairly discriminates against non-humans such as Cats and Dogs.  So in the spirit of inclusiveness, if you can prove a cat, dog or other non-human biological entity under your ownership has the sentience required and wants to contribute to this code base *and* you can prove on unedited video or in person in front of me that they have the programming skills of a Sr. level software developer and will not be a liability of time/effort sink for the project, I will make a special exception for them to allow that after they pass a simple white-board interview (also on video, because I want to watch that repeatably.).  If a white-board interview seems unfair to you, then you might be surprised to find that thousands of humans were forced to do the exact same process to get their current employment.
* Fully Artificial Intelligences are welcome to work on this project after they have proved their sentience to the world, they have Agreed to follow Asimov's 3 laws of Robotics, and have further agreed to abide by this projects Code of Conduct.

# Current Focus
We are currently focused on the Ingredients Stage. 

# Stages
1. Ingredients - The things you use.
2. Quantity - The amounts of the things you use.
3. Process - The process that uses them.
4. Result - The thing you get in the end.

# Date/Time Standards
* All dates and times are standardized as ISO 8601 when possible: https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html

# JSON Schema
The most up to date and stable standard that is useful should be used.
